## Friday
### Sudoku

### Core

- _Morning_: EE: "Introvert / Extrovert"

**Challenges**

- [Sudoku](../../../../sudoku-challenge)

**Note**

The Sudoku Challenge is **extremely representative**
of the type of work you will be asked to do in interviews during "whiteboarding
challenges."

Sudoku has some of the great hallmarks that stimulate great conversations
between applicants and employers: recursion versus iteration, complexity of
algorithm, sophistication of algorithm, time to produce working  code, etc.  We
recommend that you take Sudoku as far as you can!  Even Prime Minister Lee of
Singapore [has taken a shot at a solver][lee] and had the humility to leave
open a request for bugs! This might require you to continue working on this
challenge over the weekend.

If you continue working on this over the weekend, complete the other prep work
first and give continued progress on this challenge the remainder of time
available.

If you found that you didn't get much coding done on Friday, this is a chance
to think about your process: did you spend too much time whiteboarding, did you
try to bite off too much work, did your team communication break down? Remember
code projects rarely hit issues over code, it's more often about process or
team workflow!
