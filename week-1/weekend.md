## Weekend

### Core

**Challenges**

Either with a pair or on your own, complete the following challenges.
- [Review: Abstract Data Structures](../../../../review-abstract-data-structures-challenge)
- [Review: Calculating Subsets with Recursion](../../../../review-calculating-subsets-with-recursion-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect and Iterate](../../../../review-reflect-and-iterate-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect on Learning](../../../../review-reflect-on-learning-challenge)
- [Review: Revisit Roman Numerals](../../../../review-revisit-roman-numeral-challenge)

**Review**
- [Top Challenges](../resources/key-challenges-p1w1.md) - This is list of the key challenges from week 1. We strongly suggest that you solo on any of these challenges on which you struggled.


**Prep for Monday**

- Watch [Inheritance & Mixins](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/inheritance-and-mixins) (closed captioning available) to learn how inheritance and modules work in Ruby.
- Read Chapters 2 and 3 of [Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby](http://amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B0096BYG7C/).  There are hardcopies available on the DBC bookshelf.  As you read, come up with your own real-world object--like the author's bicycle--and try to apply each concept to your object.  You should finish reading the book throughout Week 2.
- Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#expose_your_ignorance).  It's really hard for smart, hard-working, passionate people to admit when they don't get something. Our natural tendency is to guard our ignorance so that everyone thinks we're competent.  Effective developers expose their ignorance. Period.
- [Ruby Scope](../readings/ruby-scope/README.md)

### Inspiration

- The challenges provided during the week are a guide to start you on a learning path. They should serve as a minimum goal for your learning.  For the high bar, consider that some of our students [wrote and published their own gem](https://github.com/sandbochs/local_message) while still in Phase 1, [wrote useful applications](http://www.codequizzes.com/) over the weekend between phase 1 and 2, and went on to [generally change the world shortly thereafter](https://devbootcamp.com/blog/2013-08-19-how-dbcers-are-turning-your-browser-into-a-snake-playing-gosling-loving-wonderwolrd).
