# Phase Config

`challenges.json` should not be edited. It is generated by a git pre-commit hook
that uses bin/build-challenge-json to scan the phase guide for challenge links and
build the challenge list.

Please install the git pre-commit hook by running bin/install-hook from the phase
guide root. Once installed, config/challenge.json will be updated automatically
when you commit changes to this guide.
