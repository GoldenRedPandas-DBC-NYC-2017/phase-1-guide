# On being a student at Dev Bootcamp

For most DBC students, the first week of phase one is challenging. Beyond the technical and intellectual rigor, there are significant challenges at a personal, emotional, and physical level as well. It is normal to feel this way, but that doesn't make it easy.

In the midst of all this, a lot of questions start to crop up in your first week onsite. "How many cores should I complete?", "should I favor completion or understanding?", "how many hours should I work?", or "what do I need to know to pass the assessment?" 

These questions and feelings are important, and we'd like to address them.

First, we assume the following:

 * You're here to change your life in 9 weeks
 * You're here because you want to program for a living
 * You're here because you enjoy programming (you might not love it yet, but you feel the spark and want it to grow)
 * You're here because you want to learn
 * You're here to work hard because _you_ want to, not because we tell you to

Dev Bootcamp looks a lot like a school, but the truth is it's something very different. You will not leave with grades or a degree. Instead, you will leave this place with the ability to learn technical material quickly, effectively, and with minimal guidance. These are the qualities you must strive to develop, and they are some of the crucial qualities that set great junior developers apart from their peers. We can't supply you with motivation; the only way to be successful here is to _want_ to be here.

Questions about "how much work should I do?" are difficult to answer for two reasons.

First, every student's situation is different, so we cannot give a metric of "doneness" that is appropriate for everyone. Each student has different experiences, strengths, and goals to bring to their work. Some students have family/personal responsibilities, learning differences, disabilities, mental or physical health situations, experiences of systemic and interpersonal oppression, or other considerations that may affect their energy, health, schedule, and work.

Second, there is no metric for "done" at Dev Bootcamp because your learning is never done. Finishing your cores doesn't mean you're "done" because there are stretch challenges. Finishing stretch challenges doesn't mean you're "done" because you can start a side-project. Finishing a side-project doesn't mean you're "done" because our code is never done — with guidance, it can always be improved.  Even perfecting your own code doesn't mean you're "done", because you can always deepen your own understanding and communication skills by mentoring a fellow student.

Passing an assessment doesn't mean you're done either. There is more material ahead of you, and more material behind you that could benefit from reflection, refactoring, and further comprehension.

Repeating, or being on track to repeat, doesn't mean you're done. Every second counts, and you should use your time to strengthen your weaknesses and advance your strengths.

If you're having a hard day or a hard week, don't despair. Keep going and do the best you can. This may be very different than anything you've ever done before. You are shaping your brain to think in a fundamentally new way. It will be hard and sometimes scary. Remember that, although this is your journey, we are always here to support you. 

Remember that your goal is to learn a professional craft in a very short amount of time. Comparing yourself to others will not help you learn; in fact, with as little time as you have here, you cannot afford to expend your energy this way.

If you're having an easy week, do not feel complacent or comfortable. Feel _uncomfortable_ that you could be learning or growing more but you are not.

In the programming world, there’s always something new to learn, always some new approach to learning that you haven’t tried or perfected yet. And when you’re starting out, there's always someone nearby who can draw on their own learning to help you move forward - as long as you’re aware of your own ignorance, and actively curious about how to expose and confront it. 

Living in this reality makes you an _apprentice_, and embracing this reality requires an apprentice mindset.

Make no mistake, finishing cores will not get you a job, finishing them quickly will not get you a job, and passing the assessment will not get you a job. What matters to employers is _who you are when when you exit_. You are attempting to learn a body of material that takes most people years. You are attempting to be competitive in a market made up of experienced programmers, juniors from other bootcamps, and CS grads. You are attempting to transform yourself into a world-class learner, an ideal apprentice. You can do it, but it's going to take a lot of work, and probably more than you were anticipating.

We talk about the optimal learning zone being a mix of safety and discomfort. As you progress here, do not allow yourself to slip into the comfort zone, because you cannot afford to. Many of our grads find employment, but some do not. You are here to learn as much as you possibly can before you exit to increase your odds of getting hired as a junior dev. We are here to support you in your learning and in your job search, but ultimately this is up to _you_.

So what guideline can we provide? If it's not the assessment, or the number of cores you finish, or the number of technologies you become comfortable with, then how can you judge if you're "doing things right?"

All we can offer is this. Every night, before you go to sleep, pause and reflect on the day and ask yourself this question:

> "Did I work as hard I possibly could have while maintaining my mental and physical health today?"

Remember that hard work here is not only measured in hours spent coding. Did you try something new? Did you grow as a person? Did you have a feedback conversation that challenged you? Did you make better use of your time than you did yesterday? If the answer is "no, I could have worked harder", ask yourself _why_ that is, and then ask yourself _how_ you can push harder. Remember that DBC is probably one of the most supportive environments you will ever have to take these personal and technical risks.

On the other hand, if the answer is, "no, I sacrified my well-being today", ask yourself what you need to adjust going forward to make this work sustainable for you. It’s impossible to maintain a good apprentice mindset through a fog of panic or burnout.

With this in mind, let's revisit those questions we started with:

> "How many cores should I complete?"

If you're working as hard as you can, you will get as many cores done as you possibly can, and you will work to make up the ones you miss. At the end of the day or the week, you should be able to say, "I did everything that I could."

> "Should I favor completion or understanding?"

You should favor both. The program is designed for both. This is what you're here to do.

> "How many hours should I work?"

As many as you can while maintaining your health and well-being. You will find your own ways to achieve this balance. They will be different for everyone. We can't tell you how to take care of yourself, but we're here to listen when it gets hard. Our onsite counselor is an invaluable resource.

> "What do I need to know to pass the assessment?"

A dedicated apprentice would refactor this question as, "what do I need to know to be a junior developer?" Keep your focus on that goal at all times and it will help guide you. Passing an assessment will not make you a junior developer, and cramming for one won't either.

Assessments at Dev Bootcamp are not a way of testing your knowledge; they're a way for us to determine what you need in the next stage of your learning. Some students will be ready at the end of a phase to learn new content, others will need to invest more time in the content they've already been exposed to. Both outcomes are normal, acceptable, and positive. Both outcomes are in pursuit of your ultimate goal — to become a programmer.

Your guiding lights at Dev Bootcamp are present but few. Please keep them in mind:

At all times, be honest with yourself and with others.

At all times, be kind to yourself and others.

At all times, bring your whole self to bear on the problems in front of you. 

There is a piece of each of you that knows what it means to work tirelessly and relentlessly. Find it and embrace it. We have created a space and community designed to support individuals who embark on a journey of extraordinary effort, and we're here to help guide and support you on that journey. The rest is up to you.
