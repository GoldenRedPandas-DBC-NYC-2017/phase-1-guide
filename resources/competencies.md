# Challenge Specific Learning Competencies

[Week 1](#week-1)

## Week 1

As you work through the challenges, you will see these competencies.  When you complete a challenge, consider your level of understanding of each competency.  Competencies overlap and are on several challenges, so you may not fully grasp them until you have seen them many times.

### Understand principles of language structure and execution

- Think creatively about problem solving and can identify and compare multiple solutions.
- Read a program and evaluate the code in my head, easily identifying areas of confusion or unknown tools/concepts.
- Build programs to satisfy a suite of test code.

### Write "driver code" to test and drive development

- Explain the difference between the "core" code of a program and code which exercises/evaluates that program.
- Create ruby statements that encapsulate an expectation and outputs a meaningful evaluation of methods and objects.
- Can infer the behavior and structure of code variables, methods, and objects accessed from driver (test) code
- Can define an expectation for a program or method and follow the methodical process of (Red, Green, Refactor) in TDD speak
- Can use EDD and TDD for developing incrementally and quickly reaching a stable minimum viable product.

### Debug methodically and effectively

- Identify where the error is, decipher the error message, and infer the likely source of the error
- Use puts statements to view variable states and method returns to decipher non-obvious bugs
- Know the solution to most common error messages,  and be able to explain succinctly why the error occurred
- Create a succinct description of an error that will yield accurate search results.
- Use a debugging tool to stop the program during runtime, access variable states, and step through line by line
- Use multiple different methods to zero in on non-obvious bugs (including debuggers, sniper commenting, consoles (sqlite, rails console), etc)

### Articulate algorithm design in multiple formats (pseudocode, image, verbal, plain english, etc.)

- I can recognize models that are accurate models for a problem and realize that models will always have a limitation in their approximation of the problem.
- Can abstract a pattern for a model after identifying repetition in code and relationships in data.
- Can choose appropriate test cases for a problem, and use them to create a more abstract general design.
- Translate between different modes of modeling
- Identify edge cases that uncover the nuances of the problem, and test the efficacy of my models appropriately.
