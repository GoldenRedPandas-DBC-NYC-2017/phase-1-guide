# The Three Agreements: Integrity, Kindness, and Effort

At Dev Bootcamp, we have three agreements that guide our actions (this includes staff). We expect every person to uphold these values every day. By enrolling in DBC, you agree to these agreements.

## Integrity

In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is "doing the right thing even when no one is watching."

At Dev Bootcamp, we are asking you to do an incredible thing: to learn how to be a web developer within a matter of weeks. For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have made Dev Bootcamp successful.

At Dev Bootcamp, we have codes of conduct that support an optimal learning environment and ensure that everyone gets the most out of the program. We expect you to be in integrity with:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the challenges each week
- Communicating with your accountability group when you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting and rating feedback
- Going through the entire process outlined in each challenge

Part of being in integrity also means that when you fall out of it for whatever reason (such as being a human being) you own up to it. Most of the time all it takes is and acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

## Kindness

We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice"; they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does not preclude giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is **A**ctionable, **S**pecific, and **K**ind (ASK).

We expect all students and staff to show kindness by providing feedback and code reviews to one another, informing one another when someone has fallen out of integrity, and by bringing ourselves 100% into every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space.

Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself. You've taken a big risk and are making a big change. Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program.

## Effort

This may be the most straight-forward agreement. In essence, we expect you to bring your whole self (your intelligence, focus, creativity, and personality) into each challenge every day. This means that we expect you to do your best to meet each learning competency. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (including staff) for help.

We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about *learning*. We expect you to demonstrate effort and mastery of each learning competency by completing the challenges.

## Accountability

**Not meeting these agreements are grounds for being asked to leave the program (at any phase).** Staff are responsible for maintaining a safe, positive, and inspiring learning environment for all students.

If we notice that a student is consistently failing to comply with these agreements, we will give a them a warning. If the breach of agreement continues, we will ask them to leave.

Part of the special sauce of DBC is that we hold each other to these agreements. We all make mistakes and will fail at points. What is important is how you learn from and respond to you your mistakes. In that spirit, we will give you feedback  Rather, we simply want to remind you of your agreement to come to DBC in integrity, with kindness, and with effort everyday. We want to give everyone the opportunity to meet these agreements, and as such will provide as much kind, actionable, and specific feedback as we can when we notice people straying from these agreements.

In the interest of collectively building an awesome learning environment, we ask that you do the same. And it starts with self-awareness: if you can call yourself out for slipping in one of your agreements, that is fantastic. Self-feedback is just as important as interpersonal feedback.

We also recognize that life happens which can make it impossible to meet every agreement all the time. In these situations, it's vital that you communicate with students and staff regularly to create a personal action plan that will get you on back on track. At Dev Bootcamp, we hold a very high bar to measure your success and we expect that you leverage all the supports we provide to help you get there - teachers, tutors and your fellow cohort mates.
