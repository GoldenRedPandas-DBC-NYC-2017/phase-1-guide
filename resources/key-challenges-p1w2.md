Here is a list of the key challenges from week 2. We strongly suggest that you solo on these challenges this weekend using your new found modeling skills.

If you have time, also consider doing [Battleship](../../../../battleship-challenge) with your new OO skills.

Have a great weekend!

#### Key Challenges

##### [Ruby Drill Accessor Methods](../../../../ruby-drill-accessor-methods-challenge)

Knowing how to expose instance variables with attr_[reader/writer/accessor] is critical to being able to work with classes in Ruby. Remember, instance variables are inaccessible from outside the class -- methods are the only way you can get or set an instance variable.

##### [Orange Tree 1 Just Oranges](../../../../orange-tree-1-just-oranges-challenge)

This challenge is a great intro to modeling a system using classes, protecting certain actions (like changing the age or number of oranges of the tree) and decided which classes are responsible for certain data & behavior.

##### [Design Drill Classical Inheritance](../../../../design-drill-classical-inheritance-challenge)

Consider this challenge a playground for understanding how inheritance and modules work in Ruby. Be sure you've tried things outside the prescribed releases. Be curious!

##### [Parsing Data 1 Csv In Csv Out](../../../../parsing-data-1-csv-in-csv-out-challenge)

More than just CSV parsing, this challenge was your introduction to an important concept -- mapping "pure" data (lists, strings, numbers) to objects. Become familiar with the temporary (in memory) representation of models and how it's possible to persist those in memory objects back to a data store (in this case a CSV file).

##### [Cookies And Ovens](../../../..//cookies-and-ovens-challenge)

Similar to the Orange Trees Challenge, you'll practice modeling real world objects and their behavior. Consider the boundaries between your objects. What do you decide to share between objects and how?

##### [Design Drill Argument Order Dependency](../../../../design-drill-argument-order-dependency-challenge)

While this challenge is primarily focused on a more flexible approach to passing arguments, it's also a great challenge to practice working with hashes in Ruby.
