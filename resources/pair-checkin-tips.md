# Pair Programming

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Guidelines for Effective Pair Programming

####  Beginning Pairing

1. Mini Check-in
  - Talk with your pair about how they are feeling that day/week. 
  - Is there anything going on in your life that may affect your pairing?
  
2. Pairing and Learning Styles: 
  - Choose driver and navigator roles.  Decide on time intervals for switching.
  - What factors contributed to your best pairing session? 
  - What factors contributed to your worst pairing session?
  - How do you learn and engage with the challenges?

3. Discuss your education goal today. 
  - What are your technical goals today?  Is there a particular subject you'd like to understand?
  - Is there a goal of getting better with an aspect of pairing?
  
4. Talk about skill differences. 
  - How is your command of the days material? 
  - Taking the risk to name skill differences up front allows the pair to navigate these differences so neither pair     feels left disengaged with the material.
  
5. Agree on ways to celebrate success and deal effectively w/ frustration and blockages (and follow through!)

#### During Pairing

1.  Close email, chats and turn off notifications.
2.  Using a journal or whiteboard to jot down notes can be a great tool. It allows you to continue pairing while keeping a log of questions you may want to ask an instructor later.
3.  Make sure you are bouncing back and forth between driver-navigator roles and practising the Pomodoro technique.
4.  Avoid non-essential conversation with others while you and your pair are working. However, you and your pair may want to check in with other groups to share knowledge and discuss strategies.
6.  Check in at regular intervals throughout the day to make sure above agreements are holding.
7.  If you find yourself getting stuck or spending a long time on a challenge, check-in with an instructor and determine if you should move on.

Pairing is a huge part of your DBC experience, and it's important to think of pairing as a learnable skill, just like any technical proficiency you're working on. It can be very hard to become a good pair and ask others to do the same, so it's best to start practicing these habits early, and stick with them each day.

That said, sometimes the difficulty comes from a toxic interpersonal dynamic.

If you are finding that a specific pair dynamic is so difficult that it is actively hindering your ability to learn anything at all, please let your cohort lead know right away.



#### Follow Up

1. Give Feedback  
  - Make it actionable, specific and kind.
  - Remember to distinguish between impact and intention.  (Don't assume your pair's intention when describing the       impact it had on you).
  - Be authentic and be specific about positive feedback.
